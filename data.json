As soon as I open my eyes, you're floating above your eyelashes\" - so we could confess our love for the ancient, proud, hospitable, free Georgia. It is difficult to determine unequivocally what makes the Sakartvelo region so dear to us: hospitality and toasts, the harsh beauty of mountain temples or taverns of old Tbilisi, \"Kindzmarauli\" or \"Suliko\", lezginka or the simple-minded art of Pirosmani. We come here to drink Borjom and walk around the year-round blooming Batumi, bask on the Black Sea beaches and breathe in the eternal beauty of the Caucasus Mountains, in the end - just live in Georgian. And when upon arrival they ask where we have been for so long, we will answer classically: \"First at the wake of Prince Kipiani, then at the christening of Prince Vardiani, then in a restaurant, and then in dukhan.\""}]}
