We come here to drink Borjom and walk around the year-round blooming Batumi, bask on the Black Sea beaches and breathe in the eternal beauty of the Caucasus Mountains, in the end - just live in Georgian. And when upon arrival they ask where we have been for so long, we will answer classically: \"First at the wake of Prince Kipiani, then at the christening of Prince Vardiani, then in a restaurant, and then in dukhan.\""},{"id":"JDAPUNXnZQdYxKnTC8Teo","createAd":"11:03:2022","title":"Norway","view":"Mountains","content":"There is much to enjoy among the peaks, valleys, and plateaus of the Norwegian mountains both in the winter and in the summertime, but the beauty and serenity can quickly turn dangerous.
